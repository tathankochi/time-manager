# Project Brief

## Overview
Time Manager is a Next.js application for tracking and organizing time across tasks and routines.

## Goals
- Provide fast, simple time tracking with a clean UI.
- Support task organization (projects, tags) and summaries.
- Enable persistence (local-first, cloud-ready later).

## Non-Goals (for now)
- Team collaboration or multi-tenant accounts.
- Complex reporting or billing.

## Success Criteria
- Users can create tasks, start/stop timers, and view daily/weekly totals.
- Core flows are accessible and responsive on mobile and desktop.

## Constraints
- Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind/PostCSS per existing setup.
- Keep dependencies minimal.

## Milestones
1. Core timer and task CRUD.
2. Daily/weekly summaries.
3. Basic persistence.
4. Polishing and UX improvements.
