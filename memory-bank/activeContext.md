# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implement TaskContext for task management with full CRUD operations.

## Recent Changes
- Created TaskContext with complete Task interface and TaskState.
- Implemented all required methods: addTask, updateTask, deleteTask, toggleTask, updateTaskStatus.
- Added query methods: getTodayTasks, getCompletedTasksCount, getTasksByCategory, getImportantTasks.
- Added utility methods: checkTimeConflict, getTasksForWeek.
- Added localStorage persistence for tasks.
- **UPDATED**: Linked tasks to users via userId field.
- **UPDATED**: Auto-sync currentUserId with UserContext.
- **UPDATED**: All operations now filter by current user.

## Next Steps
- Create task management UI components.
- Add task creation and editing forms.

## Recent Fixes
- **FIXED**: Added TaskProvider to UserLayout to resolve "useTask must be used within a TaskProvider" error.
- **FIXED**: Fixed typo in dashboard component ("user client" â†’ "use client").

## Decisions
- Keep the app solo-user and local-first initially.
